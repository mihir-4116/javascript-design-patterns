/*
The singleton pattern is a type of creational pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. 
This allows the class to create an instance of the class the first time it is instantiated; however, 
on the next try, the existing instance of the class is returned. No new instance is created.
*/

/*
The singleton pattern is mostly used in cases where you want a single object to coordinate actions across a system. Singletons are mostly used by:

Services: services can be singleton since they store the state, configuration and provide access to resources; hence, it makes sense to have a single instance of a service in an application.

Databases: when it comes to database connections, databases such as MongoDB utilize the singleton pattern.

Configurations: if there is an object with a specific configuration, you donâ€™t need a new instance every time that configuration object is needed.
